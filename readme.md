This program was designed to fix save slots for the game Schedule I.

***Use this application at your own risk. It should be fairly safe, as it warns you for confirmation when potentially about to do anything unsafe as well as to backup, but safety is not guaranteed.***

This program is not comprehensive and cannot fix all forms of save slot corruption, but it should be able to conveniently fix most. Worst case, generally you might have a little bit of game progress lost.

The auto fix feature should catch most basic corruption of the save. But if you notice that you've lost ownership of a property or business, lost relationship with customers, or lost your phone message with a supplier, there are some built in features to correct them on an individual basis.

This program was designed for the Steam version of the game. If Schedule I was released on any platform other than Steam, support is not guaranteed.
